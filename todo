Long term goals:
Start first round of implementation build
Rebuild test machine with zfs boot environments
IPv6 router build
Local package cache for freebsd packages
pkgbase
translate non-base package init services into daemontools services

Short term goals:
Git server - Write a salt state to create a git server. Repo creation should be a separate state. User access should be via SSH with a service account.
DNS server with DNSSEC - Write a salt formula to set up a DNS server, probably using KnotDNS. Use a local unbound instance for resolution. Clients will use this DNS server via the IPv6 router advertisement options
NTP server - Use openntpd instead of ISC NTPd which is in base. Create a separate state to have clients use the server for their NTP needs.
SSH - Write salt state to have a standard sshd and ssh client setup. Include provision for service accounts to authenticate to specific authorized_keys files in /usr/local/ssh
Salt master and minion setup - Write a salt state to bootstrap the salt master and install salt minion. 

https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/gitfs.html#serving-from-a-subdirectory - Allows for a monorepo and can then select a subdirectory in the repo for use as the salt backend

Syslog centralised logging - Create salt state for a central syslog server. Create a separate state for syslog clients.
Auditd - Create a salt state to configure auditd to audit events. zip, encrypt and transfer closed audit trails to a central server.
IPv6 router - Build a IPv6 router. Use this server as the router and NTP server. Clients should connect using ipsec
Buildbot - Create a state for buildbot master creation.
TICK stack - monitoring
Netdata and prometheus - monitoring
openntpd - replace base system ntpd
